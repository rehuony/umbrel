umbrel-dev

Automatically initialize and manage an umbrelOS development environment.

Usage: make dev DEV_COMMAND=<command> ARGS="<args>"

Commands:
    help                      Show this help message
    start                     Either start an existing dev environment or create and start a new one
    logs                      Stream umbreld logs
    shell                     Get a shell inside the running dev environment
    exec -- <command>         Execute a command inside the running dev environment
    exec:noninteractive       Execute a command without interactive mode (for CI)
    client -- <rpc> [<args>]  Query the umbreld RPC server via a CLI client
    rebuild                   Rebuild the operating system image from source and reboot the dev environment into it
    recreate                  Recreate the dev environment using the existing operating system image
    restart                   Restart the dev environment
    stop                      Stop the dev environment
    reset                     Reset the dev environment to a fresh state
    destroy                   Destroy the dev environment
    production-mode           Disables dev server, live reload and umbreld > ui proxy. Resembles close to production behaviour.
    development-mode          Disables production mode.

Environment Variables:
    UMBREL_DEV_INSTANCE       The instance id of the dev environment. Allows running multiple instances of
                              umbrel-dev in different namespaces.
    UMBREL_DEV_OPTIONS        Optional custom parameters passed to 'docker run' when creating the dev environment.

Note: umbrel-dev requires a Docker environment that exposes container IPs to the host. This is how Docker
natively works on Linux and can be done with OrbStack on macOS. On Windows this should work with WSL 2.
