 * it to the element that carries the visual `rounded-*`, since the ring is a
 * box-shadow and follows that element's own radius. Where the radius lives on a
 * parent, put the ring on an `after:inset-0 after:rounded-*` pseudo-element
 * instead (see `machines-list.tsx`).
 *
 * Elements that get their focus ring from `<Button>` already have this.

 * measures ~1.2:1 against the lightest shipped wallpapers — far below the 3:1 that
 * WCAG 1.4.11 asks of a focus indicator. The dark offset band gives the ring an
 * edge to sit against, so it stays legible whatever the wallpaper is.
