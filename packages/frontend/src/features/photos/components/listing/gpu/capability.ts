// every item in the band it draws, so `slot = itemIndex mod slotCount` can
// never put two visible items in the same cell — a band is a contiguous run
// of indices. There is then no eviction policy, no LRU, no free list and no
// rectangle packer: `resident[slot] !== id` means "upload it". Everything
// here exists to keep that invariant true, and when even the finest cell
// cannot hold a bandful, it is the zoom floor that moves rather than the
// atlas that overflows.
//
// None of this touches a GL context except `webgl2Limits`, which asks one
// throwaway context for two numbers. That is deliberate: the decisions worth
// getting right are arithmetic, and arithmetic can be tested.
