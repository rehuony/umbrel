// There is no queue here and no cancellation bookkeeping. The wanted set *is*
// the items on screen, the order *is* nearest the focal point first, and both
// are recomputed from the current view — so a tile that scrolls or zooms away
// is dropped by construction rather than cancelled by something that
// remembered to. What is left is a cap, an outward walk and six promises.
//
// The cap is the browser's own. umbreld is plain HTTP/1.1, so a browser opens
// six connections per origin; a seventh request queues *inside* the browser,
// where we can no longer reorder or usefully cancel it. Making our cap the
// browser's cap means our queue is the only queue, and the careful ordering
// survives.
//
// Ordering is the anti-popcorn mechanism. Because arrivals come outward from
// where the eye is, the fill reads as a wave from the focal point; a stagger
// timer would be worse, because it decouples the animation from the truth.
