// A live photo on the stage: the still everyone already sees, and under it
// this — the pair's motion clip (CONTRACT.md `/api/photos/live/:id`) and a
// LIVE chip. The clip plays through once when the photo arrives
// (the way Photos on a Mac greets a live photo), and again on demand:
// press-and-hold anywhere on the picture — the iPhone gesture, looping
// until the finger lifts — or, with a mouse, rest on the chip. The chip is
// also a button, so a tap or Enter plays one pass for hands the other
// gestures don't fit.
//
// The still never leaves: the video sits over it and only ever fades in
// once frames are actually rendering (the `playing` event), so a browser
// that can't decode the clip — Apple pairs are often HEVC — or an iOS Low
// Power Mode that refuses autoplay degrades to exactly the photo it was. A
// decode error unmounts the whole layer: no chip that does nothing, no
// broken player. The crossfades mask the seam between the still (a frame
// from the middle of the clip) and playback from its start.
//
// Mounted only for the item the eye has rested on (see ItemViewer's
// REST_MS): mounting is what starts the download, and flying along the
// strip must not fetch a video per flown-over item.

// How long a press must stay put to become a hold — a tap has released by
// then — and how far it may wander before it is a drag. The slop is the
// stage's own axis lock (stage-gestures LOCK), so the two agree on which
// gesture the finger meant, and whichever claims it first wins.
