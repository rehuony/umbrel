// stills, the 1280 rendition's bytes, through a detached <img> the stage's
// own <img> then picks up from the browser's cache. Videos are never
// prefetched: the player streams what it needs once it is actually looked
// at, where a skipped-over video would have sunk a file of any size — their
// warmed detail only spares a step onto one the detail round trip (the
// stage's rest gate still holds).
//
// Prefetching starts only once the item being looked at is `settled` — its
// own original on screen — so it never competes for the wire with what the
// eye is on, and only after a beat of rest. A step retargets it, and a leap
// somewhere else abandons whatever is still in flight.

// behind it; both are session-wide singletons, so warming is idempotent and
// a repeat call costs nothing
