# Rugix `state-reset/prepare` hook to reset the config and main disk data partition.
#
# Rugix calls this before a normal state reset so RAID config does not survive on the
# config partition. umbreld also calls this directly for factory resets while the
# active data mount is a RAID dataset. In that case Rugix must not reset state,
# because that would move/reset the RAID-backed install we need onboarding recovery
# to find. Calling only this hook clears the boot/config state and wipes the boot
# disk data partition while leaving the RAID pool untouched.
